#There are four collection data types in Python
#List: is a collection which is oredered and chegeable(modifiable). Allows duplicate members
#Tuple: is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable or unmodifiable(ummutable). Allow duplicate members
#Set: is a collection which is unored, un-indexed and unmodifiable, but we can add new items to the set. Duplicate members are now allowed


#A list can be empty or it may have different data type items

#How to Create a list
#Using Buil-in func
list = list()
empty_list = list()
print(len(empty_list))

#Using square brackets
lst= []
